# Advanced Addition World

## Level 4: `eq_iff_succ_eq_succ`

Here is an `iff` goal. You can split it into two goals (the implications in both
directions) using the `split` tactic, which is how you're going to have to start.

`split,`

Now you have two goals. The first is exactly `succ_inj` so you can close
it with

`exact succ_inj,`

and the second one you could solve by looking up the name of the theorem
you proved in the last level and doing `exact <that name>`, or alternatively
you could get some more `intro` practice and seeing if you can prove it
using `intro`, `rw` and `refl`.
